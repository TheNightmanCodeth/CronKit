# CronKit

A Swift package for managing Cron jobs on macOS/Linux

This repo is a WIP, when CronKit is ready for release this readme will be updated with installation/usage instructions.

For now, if you'd like to contribute, make sure to run the package build using the `swift` command-line tool and the `--disable-sandbox` flag. It will not run with XCode as of now, I'll have to find a way to hack together a solution ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
